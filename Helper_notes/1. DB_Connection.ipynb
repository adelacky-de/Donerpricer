        "### Goal: Master storing and retrieving price data in the cloud.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this project, we don't just store data in a simple text file or \"hardcode\" numbers directly into our code. We use **Supabase**. Think of Supabase as a \"Power-Up\" for your database—it’s like a supercharged Excel sheet that lives on the internet and can be accessed by your Python code from anywhere\\!\n",

        "\n",
        "Supabase is a **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)**.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **The Database (PostgreSQL)**: It uses **PostgreSQL**, one of the most professional and reliable databases in the world. It visualizes the data schema, making the tables readable and very easy to manage (add/delete rows).\n",
        "  * **The Cloud**: Your data isn't on your laptop; it's in the cloud. This makes our application **lightweight** because your computer doesn't have to carry the weight of all that data locally.\n",

        "### A. Creating a Table (The Blueprint)\n",
        "\n",
        "Before you can store prices, you need a \"Blueprint.\" In Supabase, this is called a **Table**. To build this, we use a language called **SQL** (Structured Query Language).\n",

        "| `item_name` | text | Name of the food (e.g., \"Doner Kebab\") |\n",
        "| `price_eur` | float4 | The price (e.g., 6.50) |\n",
        "| `purchase_date`| date | When you bought it |\n",
