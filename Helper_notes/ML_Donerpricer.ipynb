        "Using Ridge Regression, you will teach a computer to find the mathematical \"sweet spot\" between historical patterns and real-world price spikes. You will learn to move from raw data to a stable predictive formula, discovering exactly how much \"brand,\" \"location,\" and \"timing\" weigh in on your final bill.\n",
