        "1. **The Skeleton (`QWebEngineView`)**: This is the \"browser window\" inside your app. Without it, the map has nowhere to live.\n",
        "2. **Map Tiles (OpenStreetMap)**: This is the \"Skin\" of the world, providing images of streets and buildings.\n",
        "3. **Detective Filter (CSS Filters)**: This is the \"Clothing\" that turns a modern map into a vintage investigation file.\n",
        "4. **Footstep Markers (Markers & Popups)**: These are the \"Senses\" used to mark supermarket locations and prices.\n",
