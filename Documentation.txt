This grocery‑price tracker is a solid project idea and easier to finish than the UAV tool, while still letting you use all the libs you want.[1]

## Feasibility as course project

- It fits the course: stand‑alone Python app, clear GUI, data I/O (receipts in, predictions and charts out), and an ML component to suggest buy date/price.[1]
- Scope is controllable: you can restrict to a few items (coffee, milk, noodles) and 1–2 months of data, and still show meaningful time‑series trends and recommendations.[1]

## How to use all the libraries

- **Pandas / NumPy / SQL / Spark**:  
  - Parse uploaded receipt CSVs (or manually entered records) into a DataFrame with columns: `item_name, date, price, supermarket, location`.  
  - Store the cleaned data in SQLite; optional Spark job to aggregate by week or weekday pattern (e.g. average price per weekday).  
  - Use NumPy for feature engineering: rolling averages, price volatility, min/median/max per weekday.

- **PyTorch (ML model)**:  
  - Build a tiny model (or even simple linear baseline first) that learns a mapping from features like `weekday, days_to_salary, store_id, month` to expected price or discount probability.  
  - Given today’s date and item, the model predicts expected price for each upcoming day in the next week; you choose the day with lowest predicted price as the “suggested buying day” and show predicted price.

- **OpenCV or Pillow**:  
  - For receipt upload, allow image receipts: use OpenCV/Pillow for basic preprocessing (grayscale, thresholding, crop) and either a simple OCR pipeline or manual “assist” (first version can just accept CSV, but showing you can load and display the receipt image already demonstrates the library).  
  - Also generate the chart image: if you don’t use matplotlib directly, you can draw a simple bar chart using Pillow/OpenCV and then display it in the right‑bottom pane.

## UI layout (matching your sketch)

- **Left‑top: search bar**  
  - Text box + dropdown of matching item names from the DB.  
  - If no match: show “No such item in history yet.”  

- **Left‑bottom: recommendation panel**  
  - For selected item, run the ML model on the next 7–14 days and display:  
    - “You should buy on: Monday (avg. predicted price: 1.29 € at Aldi).”  
    - Maybe a small textual breakdown: cheapest weekday, typical discount size, most frequent cheapest supermarket.  

- **Right‑top: historical table**  
  - Table with columns: Date, Price, Supermarket, Location; sortable by clicking headers.  
  - Backed by a Pandas DataFrame view from SQLite / Spark aggregates.  

- **Right‑bottom: historical chart**  
  - Bar or line chart with x‑axis = date, y‑axis = price.  
  - Colour bars by supermarket or location.  
  - Generated either via a plotting lib or manually composed with Pillow/OpenCV, then embedded in the GUI.

## Enhancing with a light “ridiculous/fun” angle

To keep it in your style, you can add:

- Small comments under the recommendation like “If you buy today, you pay the ‘too lazy to wait’ tax of +0.30 €.”  
- An optional “risk level” from the model (how confident it is that the price will be lower later this week).

So yes: this receipt‑based price advisor is fully doable, shows clear ML + data‑engineering skills, and matches the UI you sketched, while comfortably fitting the course’s stand‑alone GUI + data I/O requirement.[1]
