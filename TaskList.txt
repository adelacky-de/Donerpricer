### Project: Grocery-Price Tracker

**1. Data Handling & Backend**
*   [x] Use Supabase for data storage.
*   [ ] (Optional) Use Spark for data aggregation (e.g., average price per week/weekday).
*   [x] Feature Engineering with NumPy:
    *   [x] Calculate rolling averages for prices.
    *   [x] Calculate price volatility.
    *   [x] Determine min/median/max price per weekday. (Cheapest weekday is determined)

**2. Machine Learning Model**
*   [x] Develop a simple baseline model (e.g., linear regression) to predict prices.
*   [x] Create a function that, for a given item, predicts the price for the next 7 days.
*   [x] Identify and return the day with the lowest predicted price as the "suggested buying day".
*   [ ] Build a PyTorch model to predict expected price or discount probability based on features (`weekday`, `days_to_salary`, `store_id`, `month`).

**3. User Interface (GUI)**
*   [x] Set default window size to 800x600px (fixed).
*   [x] **Left-Top: Search Bar**
    *   [x] Implement a text box for item search.
    *   [x] Update the color of the search bar to white, and the enter text be black.
    *   [x] Narrow down the height of the search panel, to just fit the title "Search", and the search bar; and the search button.
    *   [x] Add a dropdown to show matching items from the database.
    *   [x] Update the search engine to Product; brand.
    *   [x] The brand name option should only when its really exit in the product type.
    *   [x] Display a "No such item" message if the item is not found. (Implicitly handled by empty table/recommendation)
*   [x] **Left-Bottom: Recommendation Panel**
    *   [x] Display the "suggested buying day" and predicted price.
    *   [x] Show a textual breakdown (cheapest weekday, typical discount, etc.).
    *   [x] Change the text of prediction reuslt to red.
*   [x] **Right-Top: Historical Data Table**
    *   [x] Display historical data (Date, Price, Supermarket, Location).
    *   [x] Update the table column to DATE, PRICE, avgPrice/g or /ml, SUPERMARKET, LOCATION.
    *   [x] The column name on the table should be fully shown.
    *   [x] Table size fits to the existing table width.
    *   [x] Make table headers clickable for sorting.
*   [x] **Right-Bottom: Historical Chart**
    *   [x] Generate a bar or line chart of price vs. date.
    *   [x] Provide (Monday, Tuesday...) on the x-axis.
    *   [x] Smaller the lable of x-axis.
    *   [x] The legend and axes of the plotting should be default existed.
    *   [x] The legend on the plot should not be overlapped the plotting.
    *   [x] The x-label should not be overlapped to each other.
    *   [x] The y-axis interval to be every 0.2 euros.
    *   [x] Color-code the chart by supermarket or location.
    *   [x] Embed the chart in the GUI.
    *   [x] Show info (Date, Price) when user hovers over a data point.

**4. Image Processing for Receipts (Optional)**
*   [ ] Allow users to upload receipt images.
*   [ ] Use OpenCV or Pillow for image preprocessing (grayscale, threshold, crop).
*   [ ] Implement a basic OCR pipeline or a manual-assist feature to extract data from images.

**5. Fun Enhancements**
*   [x] Add commentary to recommendations (e.g., "'too lazy to wait' tax"). (Basic witty comment in `ml_model.py`)
*   [x] Display the model's confidence level ("risk level") for its predictions.

**Note:** `seed.py` was removed as sample data is already present in Supabase.
